# 7g-nginx-rules
[GridPane](https://gridpane.com/) adapted the [7G Firewall](https://perishablepress.com/7g-firewall/) built by Perishable Press for Nginx.

In the process, they modularized it and made it possible to add custom rules to quickly and selectively selectively block or allow requests.

This repository hosts custom rules for GridPane's nginx variant of the 7g firewall.

## Instructions

For instructions on how to create and use these custom rules, see
https://gridpane.com/kb/using-the-7g-web-application-firewall/#custom-rules.

To contribute rules to the repository, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a folder for the tool, if one does not exist yet.
3. Add your rules to the folder.
4. We recommend adding a Markdown file named after the rule to your folder for credit and to document the rule.
5. Send a pull request.
